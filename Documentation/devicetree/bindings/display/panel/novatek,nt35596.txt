Novatek NT35596 based LCD panels

Novatek NT35596 is a single-chip IC solution for small or medium-sized
LTPS TFT LCD panels. NT35596 provides  several system interfaces like
MIPI/SPI/I2C.

Microtech MTF050FHDI-03 is 1080x1920, 4-lane MIPI DSI LCD panel which
has inbuilt NT35596 IC chip.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "novatek,nt35596" and one of
  * "microtech,mtf050fhdi-03"
- reset-gpios: a GPIO phandle for the reset pin

Required properties for microtech,mtf050fhdi-03:
- reg: DSI virtual channel used by that screen
- dvdd-supply: I/O system regulator
- avdd-supply: analog regulator for MIPI circuit
- avee-supply: analog regulator for MIPI circuit

Optional properties:
- backlight: phandle for the backlight control.
